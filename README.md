### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Besides being a good father and husband to my family, I am a hardworking and disciplined software developer. I love software development and have mastered a number of important technologies. In particular, I have extensive experience with libraries such as **Laravel**, **Filamentphp**, **Node.js**, **Fastify**, **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. I also have expertise in SaaS structures. Recently, I have been developing Web3 based projects in the company I work for.
